AccessYes Accessibility Widget is a free, lightweight and user-friendly plugin that adds an accessibility widget to your WordPress website.

The Accessibility Widget plugin provides tools to help your site better align with accessibility standards such as **WCAG 2.1 AA**, the **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**, and the European Accessibility Act (EAA).

AccessYes Accessibility Widget is intended to support your accessibility efforts. It does not guarantee legal compliance with ADA, WCAG, EAA, EN 301 549 or other standards. For full compliance, a comprehensive audit and remediation may still be required.
